Indian Premier League Dataset -

About this Dataset:

IPL, a widely followed cricket tournament held annually in India since 2007, has generated extensive data over the years. 
This data proves invaluable in predicting the future performances of both teams and players. I've conducted an analysis covering various objectives within this dataset.

Also, create some charts such as -

  1. What is the percentage of wins of each team?
  2. Which venue results in a win for Batting first team and vice versa?
  3. Who is the most consistent batsman and bowler in each team and also in the entire league?
  4. Who wins the most player of the matches in the tournament?
  5. Who is the most valuable player of every season?
  6. Who is the orange cap and purple cap winner year after year?
